# Curriculum Vitae - Ruben van der Leun
Because I got a bit too sick of trying to get Microsoft Word to properly format any template that I had when writing my CV, I decided to to generate the document via React. It might be a bit overdone, but I have to admit it felt a bit more comfortable to do it like this.

All the content is stored in src/data.tsx. This is to make it more easy for me to add or update content when needed. For now, the CV is in English, but I have added some code in advance to also be able to show it in Dutch. Most of the approaches are homebrew, due to this meaning to be a fairly simple web page and I didn't want to overcomplicate things.

... so yeah, I'm available for a new assignment on the 1st of January 2024. If you know or see anything, please let me know. :)
